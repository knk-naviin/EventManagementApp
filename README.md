# EventManagementApp

Creator : K.Naveenkumar R.Abinaya

The event management system is an application designed to manage events, attendees, and schedules. It leverages object-oriented principles, specifically inheritance, to represent different types of events and incorporates JDBC for database connectivity. The system also includes a user-defined exception to handle event-specific issues, such as overbooking. The application consists of at least two entity classes that interact with the database.
